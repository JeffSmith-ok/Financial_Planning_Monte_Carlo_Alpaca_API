# Retirement and Emergency Financial Planning with APIs and Monte Carlo Simulations

In this Challenge, I’ll create two financial analysis tools by using a single Jupyter notebook:

Part 1: A financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

Part 2: A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

I’ll use the information from the Monte Carlo simulation to answer questions about the portfolio in my Jupyter notebook.

## Technologies

This was developed with Anaconda, which includes Pandas, Matplotlib and Jupyter_Lab and I created it in a development environment running Python 3.7.13.

## Installation Guide

To install the programs to run the program, you have to do the following or you can open 'financial_planning_tools.ipynb' in github and read the file there.

Install Anaconda and Python. </br>

Git clone the repo and run it, pursuant to the following clone address

git clone https://github.com/JeffSmith-ok/Module_5_Challenge

cd Module_5_challenge

In the terminal type 'Jupyter Lab'
